## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
The project uses two *.csv files included in this repository

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The inspiration for this project came from an extensive text analysis presented in the September 2020 of Scientific American, its 175th anniversary issue.  In this project, I used Airbnb listings for Seattle and Boston to answer the following questions:

1. What are the terms/qualifiers most frequently used to describe the property?
2. Are there regional differences between the most frequently used terms?
3. Do the 'buzzwords' have any explanatory power when included in a model?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks have identical structures but use different data sets (Airbnb listings for Seattle and Boston, 2011-2016, respectively). Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. The data consists of two .csv files publicly available on Kaggle and included here for convenience.   

## Results<a name="results"></a>

A summary of this analysis is published on [Medium](https://medium.com/@genevievesegol/what-do-airbnb-and-scientific-american-have-in-common-abdd3ab72dbc).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
